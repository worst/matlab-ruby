== DESCRIPTION:
  
A Ruby interface to the MATLAB interpreted language.

== FEATURES:
  
* Data type conversion between MATLAB and Ruby String, Boolean, Nil and Numeric values
* Matrix, CellMatrix and StructMatrix helper classes for working with MATLAB matrices

== USAGE:

  require 'matlab'
  
  engine = Matlab::Engine.new
  engine.put_variable "x", 123.456
  engine.put_variable "y", 789.101112
  engine.eval "z = x * y"
  engine.get_variable "z"
  
  matrix = Matlab::Matrix.new(20, 400)
  20.times { |m| 400.times { |n| matrix[m, n] = rand } }
  engine.put_variable "m", matrix
  
  engine.save "/tmp/20_x_400_matrix"
  engine.close
  
  # May also use block syntax for new
  Matlab::Engine.new do |engine|
    engine.put_variable "x", 123.456
    engine.get_variable "x"
  end

== REQUIREMENTS:

* MATLAB
* GCC or some other compiler to build the included extension
* SWIG (If you want to recompile the SWIG wrapper)
* Mocha (For testing only)

== INSTALL:

Simply do the following, after installing MATLAB:

  * ruby setup.rb config
  * ruby setup.rb setup
  * ruby setup.rb install

Alternatively, you can download and install the RubyGem package for
matlab-ruby (you must have RubyGems and MATLAB installed, first):

  * gem install matlab-ruby

If you have MATLAB installed in a non-standard location, you can specify the location of the include and lib files by doing:

  * gem install matlab-ruby -- --with-matlab-include=/usr/local/matlab/extern/include \
     --with-matlab-lib=/usr/local/matlab/bin/glnx86

Also, the gem ships with the C source-code pre-built, so 
you do not need to have SWIG installed. However, if you have SWIG installed
and you want to generate the C file yourself, you can specify the
<code>--with-swig</code> option.
